# OnlyPorn V2 playback fixes

This fork contains targeted playback and compatibility fixes:

- Corrects xHamster HLS variant URL resolution so every quality no longer points to the same master playlist.
- Adds standard Stremio `behaviorHints.proxyHeaders.request` fields for xHamster, SpankBang, and Porntrex protected media.
- Preserves SpankBang custom stream arrays through a dedicated stream response without polluting metadata.
- Applies provider-specific request headers passed to the shared HTTP client.
- Resolves relative HLS variant URLs with the WHATWG `URL` resolver instead of fragile string concatenation.
- Bumps the addon version to `2.0.1`.

Deployment remains Node.js with `yarn install` and `npm start`.
